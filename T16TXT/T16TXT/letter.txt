Dear Mark, Thanks for your letter. It was great to hear from you again. Sorry, I haven’t been in touch for so long as I was busy with my exams.
In your letter you asked me about food. During the day, I eat 3-4 times. Every time it is breakfast, lunch and dinner. Talking about keeping up my physical condition - I just never miss physical education. As for bad habits among Russian teens, in my opinion main problems is smoking and alcohol. Many don’t understand what consequences can it cause.
It is great to hear that you took part in the football match. I'm very happy for you, but why did you choose football? Who is pushing you into this sport? Who won these match.
Sorry, I must finish now as I need to continue to code a cool program for the CGSG.
Write back soon. 
Best wishes, Kirill
